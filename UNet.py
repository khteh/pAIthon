    The encoder is a stack of various Encoders:

    Each Encoder() is composed of 2 Conv2D layers with ReLU activations. We will apply Dropout, and MaxPooling2D to some Encoders, as you will verify in the following sections, specifically to the last two blocks of the downsampling.

    The function will return two tensors:

    next_layer: That will go into the next block.
    skip_connection: That will go into the corresponding decoding block.
    Note: If max_pooling=True, the next_layer will be the output of the MaxPooling2D layer, but the skip_connection will be the output of the previously applied layer(Conv2D or Dropout, depending on the case). Else, both results will be identical.
