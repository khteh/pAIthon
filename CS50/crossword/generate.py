Constraint Satisfaction Problem:
- Set of variables {x1, x2, x3, ...}
- Set of domains for each variable {d1, d2, d3, ...}
- Set of constraints C
  - Hard constraints: Must be met
  - Soft constraints: Express some notion of which soluhtions are preferred over others
  - Unary constraints: Involve single variable
  - Binary constraints: Involve 2 variables
Node consistency: All the values in a variable's domain satisfy the variable's unary constraints
Arc consistency: All the values in a variable's domain satisfy the variable's binary constraints
                 To make X arc-consistent with respect to Y, remove elements from X's domain until every choice for X has a possible choice for Y

Python has a library called "python-constraint" for this problem
